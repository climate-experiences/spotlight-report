# Recoding / encoding free text responses:

- analysis work to summarise and encode answers to Q1 / Q2, test for first response, compare Q1/Q2
- analysis work to summarise and encode answers to Q3 / Q47 (what does climate justice mean?)
- analysis work to summarise and encode answers to Q12 (types of signs of climate change)
- analysis work to summarise and encode answers to Q14 (types of personal experience)
- generate codes to aggregate free text responses to Q24 / Q40 (institution or agency references)
- generate codes to aggregate free text responses to Q43b / Q44b (celebrity references)
	- future work: test Q3 for variance / outliers against non-BAME sample
- analysis work to summarise and encode answers to Q30 (In what ways would you say the effects of climate change are currently worse for BAME people in the UK)
- generate codes to aggregate free text responses to ethnicity fill-ins Q0_5_TEXT, Q0_8_TEXT, Q0_17_TEXT, Q0_11_TEXT
- recode answers to Q66 (Occupation)

# Geospatial analysis:

- simple geographical recodes on answers to Q62_2_TEXT, Q28, add column clustering responses as well by region
- JK - recode new columns encoding via Q68 (postcode) to deprivation quartile, UR8 scale, UK administrative region

- JK to study/calculate Q52a-f spiritulity scale responses; compare to other Q56

Regression:
- R to test for correlation between ...
